                  a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                  book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                  leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                  unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                  Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.
